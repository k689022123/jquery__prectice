            <h3>How much does a website cost?</h3>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>
                While we would love to be able to give a definitive, fixed price
                for a website, it really depends on the specific needs for each
                individual business. If one business needs a website comprised
                of five pages, while another has a substantially larger site of
                over 100 pages - obviously those projects are going to command
                different price points.
              </p>

              <p>
                With that being said - here are some general guidelines on what
                to expect from a pricing standpoint.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you can get by with a small website (between 3 - 10 pages)
                using a pre-designed template, you can expect to pay
                approximately $2,500.00. A mid-sized website that has anywhere
                from 11 - 25 pages, but still uses a pre-made template, will be
                between $3,000.00 - $5,000.00. If you have a lot of pages, are
                looking for something completely custom, or are looking for
                something that has special functionality such as eCommerce,
                custom calculators, or integrations with other services, you may
                be looking at anywhere from $10,000 - $20,000.
              </p>

              <p>
                Ultimately, the takeaway here is that we can accommodate
                projects of just about any budget - so long as expectations are
                set accordingly.
              </p>

            <h3>Are there any monthly fees?</h3>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>
                This will vary depending on the type of project. For logo &
                branding projects, fees will be one-time costs. For website
                projects, we will typically charge a monthly fee, depending on
                the level of service you choose. To view a full list of our
                monthly packages, click here.

            <h3>How much does a logo cost?</h3>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>Logo projects typically cost between $3,000 - $5000.</p>
              <p>
                "Why so much?" many people ask. To answer simply - because they
                require a lot of work. At least, to do them properly. And of all
                of the investments that you will make for your business, your
                logo & branding is one area where you don't want to skimp.
              </p>

              <p>
                In business, image is everything. And while your overall brand
                is based on far more than just your logo, a bad logo can create
                a strong first impression (for better or for worse).
              </p>

              <p>
                A properly designed logo requires hours of research, and
                hundreds of sketches and iterations. And with an increasing
                number of branded businesses in the world, doing research to
                verify that your mark is unique is a tedious yet necessary part
                of the process.
              </p>

              <p>
                With each logo project that we complete, we provide 3 - 5 unique
                logo concepts, a branding guide that details how to properly use
                the logo, several versions of the logo that are print-ready, and
                can be sent to any printer or publisher for easy use, detailed
                color schemes, typography & associated fonts, and design samples
                of your new logo.

              What separates Right Creative from other top design agencies in
              the area?
            </h3>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>Experience, quality, and results.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Experience.</strong> We have been designing websites
                professional since the early days of the web - before CSS was
                mainstream, and people still used tables for their website
                layouts. In the 20+ years that we have been doing this, we have
                work with and learned from many of the top voices in several
                industries. To put it simply - there are very few people in the
                world, let alone the area that can top our years of experience.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Quality</strong> At Right Creative, we hold an almost
                unrealistic standard for quality. We demand excellence in every
                project we take on, and firmly believe that the quality of our
                work demonstrates our commitment to these standards.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Results</strong> More than anything else, our focus is,
                and will always be getting results for clients. We don't care
                how pretty something is - if it is not resulting in the growth
                or obtaining of goals for our clients, then it is not time or
                money well spent. Our mission is to turn visitors into paying
                customers - and every decision that we make is rooted in that
                mission.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Other distinguishing features</strong> Some of the other
                things that separate Right Creative from other top-rated
                agencies are: we hand-code all of our websites for maximum
                results. We don't rely on Wordpress, plugins, templates or
                themes to accomplish things, and are therefore not locked in to
                the limits they pose.

            <h3>We're just starting out. How can we afford your services?</h3>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>
                We started this business from scratch, and know full-well how
                tight money can be when you are first starting out. We empathize
                with the struggles of new business owners, and therefore work
                diligently so that the new businesses that we work with succeed.
              </p>

              <p>
                The primary criteria we look for when working with new
                businesses is the seriousness of the business owner. While it is
                natural for a new business owner to be cautious with the money
                they spend - we do look for a commitment to growth. If you do
                not have a specific plan for how you intend to grow your
                business, then the reality is - you will probably never be in a
                good position to afford our services.
              </p>

              <p>
                With that said - if you are growth-minded, then we are happy to
                help you achieve that growth, and are willing to work with you
                to come up with a plan that fits within your budget and comfort
                level. Whether this is a smaller site, financing options, or a
                payment plan - we are confident that we can figure out something
                that will be mutually beneficial.

            <h3>
              What is the difference between a pre-designed site and a custom
              site?
            </h3>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>
                The difference between pre-designed and custom sites is a lot
                like the difference between buying a home versus building a
                home.
              </p>

              <p>
                Pre-designed sites start with a website that has already been
                designed and coded. These sites will allow you to customize
                colors, fonts, photos, content, and your logo - but does not
                allow you to rearrange, reposition, or change the layout of the
                site. This option is great for newer businesses or businesses
                with a smaller budget. You not only get the benefit of a
                hand-coded, customized site, but you also benefit from a smaller
                price tag and faster turnaround time.
              </p>

              <p>
                Custom sites are built from scratch, exactly to your businesses
                needs. While custom sites often have a bigger price tag attached
                to them, they are also going to be more effective at converting
                your visitors into paying customers.
              </p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Can I make edits to my own website once it launches?</h3>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>
                Yes and no. With each client that we work with, we designate
                time to figure out what content clients will need to edit on a
                regular basis, and create tools to allow them to do that easily.
                For things such as news, articles, blogs, and portfolios,
                clients will have access to the Content Management System, and
                add/edit/delete those things as needed.
              </p>

              <p>
                For other areas of the site, we request that our clients trust
                us to make those edits, so to maintain the integrity of their
                website.
              </p>

              <p>
                It is very common for clients who have full control over their
                site to see it deteriorate after a while due to non-designers &
                non-developers adding content to the site using markup & styling
                that is not cohesive with the rest of the site. What results is
                a website filled with pages containing broken-looking content,
                and improperly formatted text.
              </p>

              <p>
                Because we care about the quality of our sites, the reputations
                of our clients, and the results that they see - we prefer to let
                our clients be the experts at what they do - and us to be the
                experts at what we do.
